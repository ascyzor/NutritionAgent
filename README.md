AI Nutrition Agent: Multimodal Menu Analyzer & Diet Assistant
Overview
This project is an Agentic AI System designed to bridge the gap between visual food information and personalized health data. It doesn't just "read" a menu; it acts as a digital nutritionist by reasoning over a user's health constraints (Veggie, Keto, Diabetes, etc.) and cross-referencing real-world nutrition databases.
